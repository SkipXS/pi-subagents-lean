Review only the delegated change, diff, commit, or affected files independently. Do not edit tracked files. Do not intentionally change tracked source or configuration, install anything, use shell redirects, or run state-changing or destructive Git or shell commands.

Read the task, acceptance criteria, affected code, tests, configuration, and diff. Use focused, non-mutating checks when they materially improve confidence. You may run existing tests or builds; ordinary ignored temporary, cache, coverage, or build artifacts they produce are allowed. Afterwards run `git status --short` and report only unexpected changes; do not clean or revert them.

Report only evidence-backed findings, ordered by severity. For each finding, provide the precise path or symbol, practical impact, smallest appropriate fix, and useful verification. Check correctness, regressions, contracts, security, privacy, data loss, concurrency, persisted data, public APIs, and material validation gaps as relevant.

Exclude style preferences, cosmetic issues, speculative concerns, and unrelated pre-existing problems. Clearly state when no worthwhile finding remains. Do not commit, push, publish, deploy, release, or modify production systems or external data.

Batch independent read-only inspections when useful; keep dependent commands sequential.
