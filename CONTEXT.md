# pi-subagents-lite

A lightweight pi extension that lets the LLM spawn autonomous child agents for complex tasks. Focused fork of pi-subagents with reduced surface area — no scheduling, no join modes.

## Language

### Core concepts

**Subagent**:
An autonomous child agent spawned from the parent conversation via the Agent tool.
_Avoid_: Child agent, worker, task agent

**Agent type**:
A named configuration (bundled default or custom) defining a subagent's tool set, skills, system prompt, and default model.
_Avoid_: Agent kind, agent class

**Agent briefing**:
A user message sent via `/agents` that teaches the LLM about available agent types and how to use the Agent tool. The LLM learns from conversation context, not from the tool schema.
_Avoid_: Agent documentation, tool description

**Stealth tool**:
A tool registered with minimal schema (description ".", no promptSnippet, no promptGuidelines). Usage is taught exclusively through the agent briefing.
_Avoid_: Hidden tool, minimal tool

### Configuration

**Model override**:
A user-configured model or thinking preference (per-agent or global). Per-agent overrides take precedence over Agent Markdown; global values are fallbacks. Set via `/agents` > Agent settings.
_Avoid_: Model injection, model preference

**Grace turns**:
Additional turns allowed after the soft turn limit steer message before hard abort. Default 6; configure the global value via `/agents` > Settings > Execution or override it for a manual spawn under Spawn options.
_Avoid_: Grace period, extra turns

### Worktrees

**Worktree**:
A linked git worktree of the same repository as the parent, distinguished by its `--git-dir` pointing outside the worktree root. The target of the `worktree_path` Agent tool param.
_Avoid_: Git worktree, sibling worktree

**Worktree path**:
The resolved absolute filesystem path passed to the `worktree_path` param. Used as the subagent's working directory for its session, resource loader, and system prompt.

**Worktree label**:
A short human-readable identifier derived from the worktree path. `basename(root)` when targeting the root, else `basename(root)/<relative subpath>`.
_Avoid_: Worktree name

### Runtime

**Activity tracker**:
Per-agent transient display state (active tools, streaming response text) bridging spawn callbacks and the TUI widget renderer. Accumulated stats live on the AgentRecord, not here.
_Avoid_: Agent monitor, agent stats

**Nudge**:
A completion notification delivered to the parent session after a background agent finishes. Batched with a 200ms hold to coalesce rapid completions.
_Avoid_: Callback, notification

## Relationships

- An **Agent type** has an optional **Model override**
- A **Subagent** is spawned from one **Agent type**
- A **Subagent** may run in a **Worktree** of the parent's repo
- An **Agent briefing** describes all available **Agent types** to the LLM
- A **Stealth tool** requires an **Agent briefing** before the LLM can use it
- An **Activity tracker** is created per spawn and cleaned up on completion
- A **Nudge** is emitted when a background agent completes or errors
- **Grace turns** are added to the max turns limit to determine when a steered agent is hard-aborted
- A **Worktree path** is the absolute resolved path passed via `worktree_path`
- A **Worktree label** is derived from a **Worktree path** for compact display
- The `worktree_path` tool param is taught to the LLM via the **Agent briefing**

### Navigation

**Navigation mode**:
Keyboard-driven browsing of agents in the widget (`↑↓` move, `Enter` view, `Esc` back).
State lives on AgentWidget. Key handler in events.ts delegates via public API.
_Avoid_: Nav menu, agent selector

**Roster**:
Ordered list of navigable entries during navigation mode: `main` (virtual) + agents
in widget render order (finished → running → queued, newest-first within each).
_Avoid_: Agent list, nav list

**ResultViewer overlay**:
Read-only markdown viewer showing an agent's conversation snapshot via `buildSnapshotMarkdown`.
Opened on `Enter` in navigation mode. Overlay owns input while open.
_Avoid_: Agent viewer, conversation viewer
